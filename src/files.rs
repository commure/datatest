/// Trait defining conversion into a function argument. We use it to convert discovered paths
/// to test data (captured as `&Path`) into what is expected by the function.
///
/// Why so complex? We need a way to convert an argument received as an element of slice  `&[PathBuf]`
/// and convert it into what the function expects.
///
/// The difficulty here is that for owned arguments we can create value and just pass it down to the
/// function. However, for arguments taking slices, we need to store value somewhere on the stack
/// and pass a reference.
///
/// Theoretically, our proc macro could generate a different piece of code to handle that, but
/// to avoid the complexity in proc macro, it always generates code in the form of:
///
/// ```ignore
/// TakeArg::take(&mut <#ty as DeriveArg>::derive(&paths_arg[#idx]))
/// ```
///
/// (`#ty` is the type of the function argument).
///
/// [`DeriveArg`] is responsible for converting `&PathBuf` into an "owned" form of `#ty`. For example,
/// owned form for both `&str` and `String` will be `String` and conversion will be reading the file
/// at given path.
///
/// [`TakeArg`] is responsible for deriving argument type from the mutable reference to the
/// `TakeArg::Derived`. The reason mutable referenc is used is because, again, the generated code
/// is the same, so we cannot take `self` in one case and `&self` in other case. Instead, we take
/// `&mut self` in `TakeArg` and either convert it to the shared reference or replace the value
/// with "sentinel" (empty value) and return taken out value as result.
///
/// We pre-define few conversions:
///
/// 1. `&Path` -> `&str`, `String` (reads file content into a string)
/// 2. `&Path` -> `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>` (reads file content into a byte buffer)
/// 3. `&Path` -> `&Path` (gives path "as is")
///
/// Conversion is two step: first, we need to derive some value. Second, we need to either borrow
/// from that value (if we need `&str`, for example) or take from that value (if we need `String`,
/// for example) to pass an argument to the function.
